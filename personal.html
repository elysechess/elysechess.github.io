                    <h2>A Bit of Context</h2>
                    <p>
                        So, here's a fun fact: I never really planned on becoming an engineer. As early as six years old, I was insistent that I'd become an author and make millions off my bestselling novels.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Obviously, that hasn't happened (yet &#129310;). In the meantime, I've found that a lot of the skills involved in writing a story (breaking down big ideas into manageable tasks, keeping track of a bunch of tiny details, creating and sticking to schedules, and more) translate very nicely when applied to software engineering. I taught myself to code at thirteen, kickstarting my journey towards computer engineering. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This page is a tribute to my inner humanities major, who pops out whenever I have the time. Outside of engineering, I still love to write, draw, paint, and travel.

                            <h3 style="text-align: center;">A Portrait of an Artist</h3>
                            <p>He captured the light reflected in the regal eyes, so brown they were almost black, shadowed like the darkness that rapidly eclipsed his sight and veiled the canvas from view. He panicked momentarily as blindness overtook him. But he knew this portrait like the back of the hand that clenched the brush in a firm but trembling grasp. Besides, there was only one remaining element — the artist’s signature.</p>
                            <p>Shuddering, breathing raggedly, blood still dribbling from his nose, the blinded artist raised his brush to the canvas for the final time and signed the portrait in scrawled, looping cursive.                            </p>
                            <p>The paintbrush clattered to the floor, the lifeless husk of its spent owner close behind.                            </p>

                            <p>She had never known peace, not for one second of her roughly twenty-seven years of life, and she wasn't planning on finding it tonight.</p>
                            <p>Her hands shook only slightly as she slipped on her favorite strapless red gown and pinned back her hair. She glanced at her reflection in the gilded floor-length mirror: all angles and hard lines, shimmering red fabric stark against her white skin and platinum hair, eyes blank like a shark.</p>
                            <p>She turned away and slipped three of her favorite throwing knives into the bodice of her gown. She didn't want to be late for the rendezvous.</p>

                            <h3 style="text-align: center;">A Ghost Story</h3>
                            <p>I needed to talk to a ghost, which—believe it or not—wasn't a super rare occurrence in my life.</p>
                            <p>Usually, the ghosts came straight to me. They'd materialize in the backseat of my old Subaru while I was driving to my day job, crawl out of the TV as I was trying to enjoy a rerun of The Office, or— in the case of my first supernatural encounter—spontaneously appear behind me when I was in the middle of washing off a face mask before bed.</p>
                            <p>This ghost, though, was different. She wasn't asking me to fix whatever unresolved grievance prevented her from passing into the afterlife; instead, she was taking out her anger on a family who'd just moved from Tallahassee into a long-abandoned farmhouse in rural Vermont. My acquaintance Adam, who'd recently featured the family on his paranormal activities podcast, had sent them my way once he'd profited sufficiently from their story.</p>
                            <p>It was early October, and I'd been looking for a reason to take a vacation. I decided I'd drive to Vermont, figure out how to de-haunt this family's farmhouse, and then spend a few days hiking in the mountains before heading home. I called off work, arranged for my neighbor to check in on my cat while I was gone, and drove seven hours to Montpelier.</p>
