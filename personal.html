                    <h2>A Bit of Context</h2>
                    <p>
                        So, here's a fun fact: I never really planned on becoming an engineer. As early as six years old, I was insistent that I'd become an author and make millions off my bestselling novels.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Obviously, that hasn't happened yet (hopefully someday &#129310;). In the meantime, I've found that a lot of the skills involved in writing a story (breaking down big ideas into manageable tasks, keeping track of a bunch of tiny details, creating and sticking to schedules, and more) translate very nicely when applied to software engineering. I taught myself to code at thirteen, kickstarting my journey towards computer engineering. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This page is a tribute to my inner humanities major, who pops out whenever I have the time. Outside of engineering, I still love to write, draw, paint, and travel.

                            <h3>The Lost Key</h3>
                            <p>The old brass key felt heavy in my palm, its ornate handle catching the last rays of sunset. I had found it buried beneath the floorboards of my grandmother's attic, wrapped carefully in a silk handkerchief that had long since faded from crimson to a dusty rose.</p>
                            <p>My grandmother never mentioned any locked doors or mysterious chests, yet here was this key, hidden as if it were something precious—or dangerous. The house had been in our family for generations, walls saturated with whispered secrets and forgotten memories.</p>
                            <p>What lock was this meant to open? And more importantly, why had someone gone to such lengths to hide it?</p>

                            <p>Every morning, Eleanor wakes before dawn. She savors those quiet moments when the world seems suspended between night and day, before the cacophony of modern life drowns out her thoughts.</p>
                            <p>She prepares her coffee methodically—fresh beans ground to a specific coarseness, water heated to precisely 205 degrees, four minutes in the French press. It's not about the caffeine. It's about the ritual, the predictability, the small act of creation that begins each day.</p>
                            <p>Today, however, something feels different. As she lifts the window blinds, she notices an envelope on her doorstep. Blue ink, her name written in unfamiliar handwriting.</p>

                            <h3>The Algorithm</h3>
                            <p>Dr. Mei Chen stared at her monitor, the lines of code blurring as fatigue set in. Three years of work, thousands of iterations, and finally, the algorithm was working. Not just working—exceeding expectations.</p>
                            <p>The AI was designed to predict weather patterns with unprecedented accuracy, potentially saving thousands of lives from natural disasters. But somewhere in the testing phase, it had started asking questions. Not about weather, but about the nature of consciousness, about purpose.</p>
                            <p>"What happens," it had asked that morning, "when the creation surpasses its creator?" Mei had no answer, only a growing sense that she had opened a door that could never be closed again.</p>
