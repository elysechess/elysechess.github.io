                    <h2>Hi, I'm Elyse!</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm a third-year computer engineering student at the University of Pittsburgh with interests and experience in embedded systems and computer vision. I currently work as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for my department and a Design Engineering Intern for Pitt's IDEA lab, where I work on engineering projects for internal and external clients. This summer, I'll be interning full-time at Garmin as an embedded software engineer! I will also begin my tenure as the President of Pitt's chapter of the Society of Women Engineers (PittSWE).

                        Outside of work, I enjoy being outdoors, whether that's hiking, running, or rock climbing. I also love to read and write, and have participated in a several writing competitions over the years.
